# deskshell2-win
Deskshell windows implementation.

deskshell for windows uses nodejs and portable chrome. The windows implementation is an npm module called deskshell2-win.

## Recreating the module
Checkout this git repository into a folder called deskshell2-win.

## Nodejs

Download the windows binary (.exe.) from https://nodejs.org/download/ and save it into deskshell2-win. We suggest downloading the 32-bit executable so that it will work with 32 bit and 64 bit machines. To easily identify the binary in the process manager it is renamed from node.exe to deskshell-node.exe. If you ever want to change the version of node that is running then download a new binary and save it over the top of deskshell-node.exe

## Chrome

Download http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable and run the installer, install into deskshell2-win directory. Once again to easily identify the binary in the process manager rename GoogleChromePortable/App/Chrome-bin/chrome.exe to deskshell-chrome.exe
