# Nodejs

Download the windows binary (.exe.) from https://nodejs.org/download/ and save it into deskshell2-win. We suggest downloading the 32-bit executable so that it will work with 32 bit and 64 bit machines. To identify the binary in the process list it is renamed from node.exe to deskshell-node.exe. If you ever want to change the version of node that is running then download a new binary and save it over the top of deskshell-node.exe
